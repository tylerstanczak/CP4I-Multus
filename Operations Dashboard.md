# Deploying MQ with CP4I
Tracing is required to deploy MQ with CP4I. To enable tracing, first deploy an ``Operations Dashboard`` (OD) capability

[Installing Operations Dashboard](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-integration/2021.1?topic=configuration-installation)

### Registering a Capability for Tracing
Similar steps can be followed for registering API Connect, App Connect Enterprise, MQ, or other capabilities with the Operations Dashboard
