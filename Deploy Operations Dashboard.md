# Deploying MQ with CP4I
Tracing is required to deploy MQ with CP4I. To enable tracing, first deploy an ``Operations Dashboard`` (OD) capability

- come back to this after deploying CP4I capabilities such as API-C, ACE, MQ, etc.
The instructions for deploying MQ have a link back here when it's time to register for tracing.
